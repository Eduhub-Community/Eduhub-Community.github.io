# Tech Community

Tech Community is the practice of combining the efforts of individuals, tech enthusiasts & industry leaders, who together are inspired to create a brighter future
for all. Engaging directly with the student population to bring them into the local tech community. Removing the barriers to becoming a part of the tech community
and improving the skills and co-operation of tech workers within the city. Our Tech Communities are groups of people with similar interests or roles. Their focus is
on learning in a group setting. By getting together, these professionals can exchange tips, experiences, knowledge and strengthen ties with co-workers, something
that also strongly benefits the company. According to the interviewees, organizations decided to introduce tech communities in the company to further strengthen one of
its organizational pillars: the culture of learning. The strategy was to create a dynamic and agile system to produce and share technical knowledge that would generate
value for Venturus and its workers.

- Team Engagement
