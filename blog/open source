Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see;
it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works.
Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.
